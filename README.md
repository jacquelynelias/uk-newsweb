# uk-newsweb
This project was a yearlong research project looking at the British media's coverage of Brexit. The project consisted of many different stages from gathering data to creating a data visualization. The visualization can be viewed at uknewsweb.jacquelynelias.com

#Purpose
The purpose of this project is to research the current tension of the U.K. and the
E.U. through the lens of my fields of study: journalism, creative computation and
computer science, by pulling, analyzing, and displaying data. This project looked at the
quantity of news coverage instead of the subject matter of the article as other projects
have done over a period of time in the past in order to ultimately develop a data
visualization that graphically displays the frequency that the United Kingdom reports on
other countries. The study, however, takes a more effective approach to researching this
question by using scripts to allow large quantities of data to be analyzed quickly rather
than focusing on studying few articles in depth. The hypothesis that is being tested is that
coverage of the European Union will increase as tensions increase between the European
Union and the United Kingdom.

#Data Collection
Data was collected through a Python scraper that I wrote to gather articles 

#Data Cleaning
The data was cleaned through a python script that took the JSON that the scraper created and then created more readable tables that focused on specific subsets of the data such as just European Union countries that were used to analyze the data. 

#Data Visualization
A basic d3.js map was created that displays the quantity of British coverage being focused on certain countries. The data visualization is still being completed. 


#Data Analysis
The data collected from the scrapers then was used to create graphs and a report, showing the findings. The report can be found in the repository.
